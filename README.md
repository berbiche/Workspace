# Workspace
School homeworks from when I started programming in [CÃ©gep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEGEP).

This repository only contains some of the project I worked on in my first two years of CEGEP.
We were thought how to use git the last year (long after learning it on my own).

The code quality is that of someone learning how to program.
